"""Turns BoursoBank's dashboard HTML and trading JSON into the sidecar contract.

Two upstream shapes are parsed here:

* the account summary at `/dashboard/liste-comptes`, which is HTML grouped into
  `data-summary-bank` / `-savings` / `-trading` / `-loan` sections;
* the trading board's `accounts/summary/{id}` JSON, which carries the cash, the
  portfolio valuation, the account total and every open position.

Kept free of FastAPI and httpx, because these rules are the part that silently
breaks when BoursoBank reskins a page, and a silent break here would overwrite a
correct portfolio with a partial one. Nothing is ever coerced to zero and no row
is ever skipped to "recover": a card that looks like an account but does not
parse fails the whole sync, so the last known-good data survives.
